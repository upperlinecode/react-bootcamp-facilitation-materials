## Overview <a id="overview"></a>

This document contains a working list of some of the sessions and workshops that take place during a facilitated technical onboarding. Each of these workshops is universal enough that you could reasonably run them according to your own instincts, but this document includes tips, tricks, and best practices that can help make these sessions run more smoothly.

Please feel free to make pull requests with additional learnings as they arise.

## First Project AMA (Ask Me Anything) <a id="first-project-ama"></a>

The very nature of an AMA is that it is an unscripted, judgement-free zone for you to ask whatever might be on your mind about the topic at hand. With that in mind, most of the work for this session is about preparing for it, not in actually running it.

Here are some tips to consider:

- Plan to have 4-6 team members as panelists - you can expect at least 1 to have a last minute conflict and need to drop off, and a final panel of 3-4 is enough to still meet the objectives of this session.
- Be sure to include at least 2 team members who are very early in their tenure - their "first project" experience will be more recent and therefore easier to recall, and more representative of the current state of things for a beginner.
- Find an opportunity ahead of time to ground your panelists in the objective of this session, which is to make beginners feel comfortable on their first project. Encourage them to treat the questions which show the asker's inexperience with the _most_ dignity. Responses that begin with "I wondered this same thing" or "that's such a great thing to be thinking about" are really good ways normalize the feelings and fears someone might be feeling.
- Plan out at least five questions to get the momentum started - you can do this yourself, or set aside time to have bootcamp participants brainstorm a list of questions ahead of time.
- Every once in a while in these settings, it's possible for someone to ask a question that is esoteric enough that most other participants may not know what's going on. This moment can be really validating for the person who asked the question, but really intimidating and alienating for everyone else. Be prepared to politely pause a question that falls into this category and encourage the asker to take this conversation offline and connect separately with the SME (subject-matter expert).
- You may want to have an additional avenue where participants can ask questions anonymously - either semi-anonymously by backchanneling questions through you via Slack, or even more anonymously through a Google form or similar.

## Project Walkthrough Guide <a id="project-walkthrough-guide"></a>

Project walkthroughs are an important part of new team members’ onboarding. One of the beauties of a project walkthrough is that it is unique to the individual(s) presenting it. When you are leading a project walkthrough, we encourage you to present the pieces that you find most interesting. This may include the product impact, interesting technical implementation details, or demos of features that are particularly impressive or were particularly difficult to implement. With that said, every project walkthrough should cover a few core components:

- **Overview** - who is the client, and what is the product we’re building?
- **History of the project and client goals/motivations** - why did the client contract Giant Machines in the first place? How have those goals evolved over time? How long has Giant Machines been engaged with this project?
- **Team members on the project** - Who are the current team members and what are their roles? Who else has worked on this project in the past?
- **Client team interaction** - How does the Giant Machines team work with the client internal team on design, product, and engineering? What is the nature of that collaboration?
- **Core technologies and technical project architecture** - What are the primary tools and technologies used in this application?
- **Project Walkthrough** - a walkthrough of the core features and functionality to understand the value the product delivers to its users.

## Final Celebration & Close <a id="final-celebration"></a>

Most situations merit about 2 hours for final close and celebration, which typically includes the following:

- **20 minutes for final project presentations:** - This is honestly only worthwhile if projects have diverged enough for there to be noticeable differences between them. The extensions in week 4 should have offered ample opportunity for this to be true, but it's both discouraging and boring to watch four different presentations of near-identical projects.
- **15 minutes for graduation & affirmations:** - Take time to name the strengths you've noticed in each of the participants, and congratulate them on their growth.
- **15 minutes for closing circle:** - Spent
- **10 minutes for feedback:** -
- **Use the remaining time for a happy-hour style gathering.** - bear in mind that the name happy-hour generally carries connotations of alcohol, and so you're encouraged to simply call this the _graduation celebration_ and make special effort to ensure that there are equally interesting non-alcoholic options for those who cannot or do not wish to drink.

#### Presentations

Presentations are very flexible, but we generally encourage participants to aim for a 5-minute presentation - here's the flow we usually offer to our participants:

1. Introduce yourself (or yourselves).
2. Explain your inspiration - what did you set out to build?
3. Explain your process - how did your project evolve over the course of your work?
4. Describe the roadblocks - what was the most challenging part of this process? What did you learn from that?
5. Claim a victory - what are you most proud of?
6. Share next steps - if you had more time, what would you add?
7. Take audience questions.

#### Graduation & Affirmations

Graduation is a really fun time to celebrate the accomplishments of the team members who have worked so hard these past four weeks. Our flow for graduation is to offer an affirmation to each participant, and then confer upon them some other token signifying their graduation in lieu of a diploma - a rubber duck, a company t-shirt, or even a printed certificate will do.

Here are some tips when drafting the affirmations you'll share with participants:

- **Script out your affirmations ahead of time.** If you speak effortlessly about one participant, and then struggle to find something affirming to say about another, that comes across as an indication that one participant is superior. That impression runs directly counter to the goals of this bootcamp.
- **Balance everyone's feedback by affirming one _technical_ skill and one _interpersonal_ skill.** Speaking at length about one person's technical prowess and then talking about how another was so pleasant to be around carries the implication that the second person struggles with technical tasks.
- **Divide up the participants among the facilitators.** This lessons the load of writing affirmations, and breaks up the voices speaking during graduation.

#### Closing Circle

If anyone has joined to attend presentations, dismiss them to the celebration, let them know we'll join them shortly, and then convene the participants and facilitators for a chance to debrief the entire bootcamp experience. Here are a few questions we generally ask.

1. How are you feeling?
2. Shout out a team member for the support they've given or the example they set.
3. What victory can you claim from this experience? What will you look back on as proof of your capacity when you are tempted to doubt yourself in the future?

Give everyone time to think through their answers, and write these prompts down somewhere so they can reference them and think about them before it's their turn to speak.

This is generally a more emotional close than usual, so it's helpful to plan for it to take a bit more time than usual.

#### Feedback

Distribute the survey and have participants complete it on the spot before moving ahead. This is much easier and more effective than trying to wrangle responses asynchronously.
